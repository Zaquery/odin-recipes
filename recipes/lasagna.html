            <li class="text"><strong>Sugar</strong>: Two tablespoons of white sugar add subtle sweetness and enhance the flavor of the sauce.</li>
            <li class="text"><strong>Spices and Seasonings</strong>: This lasagna recipe is flavored with fresh parsley, dried basil leaves, salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and black pepper.</li>
